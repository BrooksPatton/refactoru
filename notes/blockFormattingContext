Block formatting context

overflow: hidden;

Effects: 
	Left edge of content lines up with the left edge of the box. (The text inside the div is not against the left edge of its own div)

	Contains other floats, contains full margin box. (The margin settings are not being honored. For example the child elements are controlling the margin of the parent element)

This is considered a clearfix, but it is not using the clear property.
