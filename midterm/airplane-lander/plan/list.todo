Description:
☐ Different colored planes fly in the sky above an airport. There are three different sizes of planes, and three different sizes of landing strips. The different sizes correspond to different colored planes and the airstrips. The Player must click on a plane, and then the landing strip that they want the plane to land at. The planes must land on a strip that can handle their size or larger. Once landed, the plan will take some time to get off the runway, and until then the runway is not available for planes to land on it. The player loses when a plane runs out of fuel and crashes.
